# Navette - Weaving thin-film systems that perform

**Navette** is a high-performance, physically rigorous 1D optical engine designed for the simulation of light propagation in stratified media. Built on a modern **Scattering Matrix (S-matrix)** architecture, it offers a numerically stable and vectorized alternative to traditional Transfer Matrix Methods (TMM).

### 1. Unconditional Numerical Stability

Traditional TMM suffers from numerical divergence (exponentially growing evanescent waves) when dealing with thick layers or highly absorbing materials. Navette utilizes the **Redheffer Star Product** to propagate scattering matrices, ensuring that all matrix elements remain bounded and physically meaningful, regardless of layer thickness.

### 2. High-Concurrency Performance

As a Principal Performance Engineer, you need tools that scale. Navette is built for speed:

- **Parallel Execution**: Utilizes Rust + rayon data-parallelism across wavelengths/angles to saturate all available CPU cores.
    
- **Vectorized Engine**: Operations are performed across the entire (wavelength × angle) coordinate space in a single pass, eliminating Python's loop overhead.
    
- **Memory Efficiency**: Collapses multi-layer stacks into a compact global S-matrix to minimize cache misses.
    

### 3. Partial Coherence Support

Real-world systems often involve thick substrates (like a 1mm glass slide) where phase information is lost. Navette features a **Hybrid Coherence Engine**:

- **Coherent Blocks**: Preserves phase for thin-film interference.
    
- **Incoherent Interfaces**: Switches to intensity-based propagation for thick layers, preventing the "unphysical ringing" caused by assuming perfect coherence across a macroscopic substrate.
    

### 4. Advanced Physics Modeling

Navette goes beyond simple Fresnel equations to provide research-grade accuracy:

- **Interface Roughness**: Implements the **Névot-Croce** model, providing superior accuracy for high-frequency or X-ray reflectometry compared to standard Gaussian approximations.
    
- **Ellipsometric Rigor**: Outputs (Ψ,Δ) parameters that strictly follow the **Azzam & Bashara** convention, ensuring direct compatibility with commercial ellipsometers (e.g., Woollam, Horiba).

### 5. Automated Coating Design

Navette doesn't just simulate — it synthesizes, with the classic **needle method** running natively on the same engine:

- **Needle Insertion**: Probes every candidate position with an infinitesimal test layer and inserts real material where the merit function improves most — the Tikhonravov needle algorithm, merit-driven and target-aware.

- **Thickness Optimization**: Levenberg-Marquardt refinement over free layers with bounds and clamping, interleaved with insertion passes and impact-ranked cleanup (merge, thin-layer removal, re-optimization).

- **Multi-domain Targets**: One joint merit over spectral, angular, and CIE color demands — multiple angles, illuminants with own-white metamerism control, and per-target wavelength windows — all folded into the needle gradient with analytic chain-rule terms, so a single run designs for daylight and showroom light at once.

- **Graded Media**: Gradient-index profiles expand natively for simulation and serve as pinned background (substrate diffusion gradients, rugate foundations) while the needle designs around them.

### Install & build

```powershell
# Single aggregated native extension (navette._navette, all engines):
maturin develop --release
# checks
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace     # everything (needs Python for binding crates)
cargo test-pure            # pure-Rust gate (no Python needed)
pytest validation
```

> **Always pass `--release`.** Plain `maturin develop` builds with the `dev`
> profile: the extension imports and computes correctly, but runs several
> times slower, so every timing taken against it is meaningless. This is not
> hypothetical — a whole round of committed benchmark results (and the
> conclusions drawn from them) had to be discarded for exactly this reason.
> `navette.build_profile()` reports which profile is installed, and the
> benches under `validation/benches/` exit rather than time a `"debug"` one.

### Architecture: Rust core, Python addon

All logic and all validation live in the `navette` Rust crate — it runs
fully standalone (file → design → solve → report, no interpreter).
The Python package is a thin addon: validated config holders, YAML→dict
parsing, result reshapes, and re-exports. Conversely every feature-level
Rust function is exposed via PyO3, so Python can drive the whole engine.
`tools/check_exposure.py` enforces this both ways in CI (see
docs/plans/exposure_audit.md).

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request:
`cargo test --workspace`, a zero-compiler-warnings check (`-D warnings`),
`pytest validation` on Windows and Linux, the exposure and CIE-sync lints,
and an assertion that the installed extension is a release build.
`cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt --check` run advisory for now — the reasons,
and what it takes to make them blocking, are recorded at the top of the
workflow.

### Layout notes

- `rust/` holds the Cargo workspace (the single `navette` engine crate
  plus the `navette-py` PyO3 aggregator) — the idiomatic Rust layout,
  publishable to crates.io.
- `src/navette/` is the Python package in src-layout — the idiomatic
  Python layout, which maturin detects automatically for mixed projects.

### Release & publish

Release automation: tag `vX.Y.Z` (must match `pyproject.toml`, workspace
`Cargo.toml`, its internal `navette` dependency, `__about__.py` and both
`Cargo.lock` entries — all six enforced by CI) →
`.github/workflows/release.yml`
builds wheels (Linux/Windows/macOS) and publishes to PyPI (trusted
publisher) + crates.io (token), leaf crates first.

```powershell
maturin build --release   # -> target/wheels/navette-0.6.9-*.whl (single wheel, all engines)
```

Manual fallback: `cargo publish -p navette`;
`maturin upload target/wheels/navette-0.5.0-*.whl`.
