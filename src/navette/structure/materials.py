  Purpose: decouple the stack model (which thinks in material *names*) from
  material storage (arrays, specs, weavers). Expansion and validation only
  ever touch these two methods, so ANY object implementing them — including
  user-defined classes that never import this module — works as a provider
  (the protocol is runtime-checkable; ``wrap_material_source`` accepts
  structural matches via ``isinstance``).

  Contract: ``get_nk`` returns a 1-D complex ``n + ik`` array for the
  material; ``contains`` reports whether the name is servable. The array's
  wavelength grid is implicit — the provider does NOT know or check what
  grid it lives on. Grid agreement with the solver is the CALLER's
  responsibility, enforced by convention: providers expose their grid via
  a ``.grid`` attribute (``None`` when unknown — user duck-typed providers
  need not implement it); the ``solve_structure`` bridge value-compares it
  against the solver grid and refuses mismatches. Length-only agreement
  (equal length, different wavelengths) is rejected, not trusted.

  Purpose: the zero-ceremony provider — hand it a ``{name: value}`` dict

  tables, offline evaluations, baked ``_table`` specs from
  ``bake_materials``). Holds the caller's dict BY REFERENCE (no copy), so
  later insertions (e.g. baked materials) are visible immediately.

  Values may be:
  - ``np.ndarray`` — served as-is (no copy, no check). The array's grid
    is implicit: the provider cannot know or verify its wavelengths.
  - :class:`MaterialSpec` (or spec dict) — evaluated on ``wavelength=``
    at construction; raises ``AttributeError`` when the value is a spec
    but no grid was given.
  - objects exposing ``.nk`` — duck-typed escape hatch, served directly.

  Behavior: a passive shelf, not a registry. It never audits which entries
  are used (a library superset is the normal case; leftovers are inert)

  expansion/validation time, downstream. Proper use: ensure every array
  value lives on the SAME grid you will solve on; the bridge only checks
  lengths, never wavelength values.

  Purpose: the provider for measured data — n/k fragments live in the
  weaver (keyed ``(prefix, label, polarisation)``, typically measured at
  one angle), and this provider resamples them onto ``target_wavelength``
  on demand. Ideal when ellipsometry spectra, not models, are the source
  of truth. Proper use: set ``target_wavelength`` to the grid you will
  solve on (output is always on that grid); match ``key_prefix`` to the
  measurement angle stored in the weaver; call ``invalidate_cache`` after
  re-weaving, since woven results are memoized and the cache cannot see
  backend changes.

  Behavior: per material, the ``n`` fragment is REQUIRED (absent →
  ``KeyError``), while a missing ``k`` fragment silently defaults to
  zeros — a pure-n entry becomes lossless rather than erroring. An
  exact-grid fast path skips interpolation when the woven fragment
  already sits on the target grid (shape AND values equal); otherwise
  ``UniInterpolator`` resamples per ``interp`` settings. The only
  provider whose contents can change under it — hence the explicit cache
  controls. Grid caveat as everywhere: nothing checks ``target_wavelength``
  against the solver's grid (the ``solve_structure`` bridge does).

  Strict vs lenient: ``strict=True`` refuses off-grid fragments instead of
  interpolating — use it when you OWN the weave (re-woven per study, so an
  off-grid fragment means a stale process, and interpolation would mask a
  workflow bug). Stay lenient when you BORROW the weave (archival/literature
  data on foreign grids, exploratory grids, coarser k-grids), where
  resampling is the legitimate bridge. Freshness workflow with a re-woven
  backend: assign ``target_wavelength`` (cache auto-clears), assert
  ``is_exact`` over your materials, then solve — any staleness raises
  instead of interpolating.
