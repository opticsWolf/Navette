"""navette.synthesis — bridge from woven targets to optimizer-ready specs.

Converts a :class:`TargetCollection` (user-facing targets over free-form
spectral labels) into a native :class:`MeritSpec` (flat CurveId demands for
the thickness optimizer and the needle fold), and builds native
``SimCurves`` rows from solver outputs::

    from navette.synthesis import build_merit_spec, sim_curves_from_arrays

    spec = build_merit_spec(collection)          # MeritSpec (native)
    sim = sim_curves_from_arrays(angles, wl,    # SimCurves (native)
                                 {"Rs": rs, "Ts": ts})
    merit = spec.merit(sim, 1e6)
    folded = build_needle_targets(spec, angles, wl, sim)  # needle inputs

``folded`` carries one ``{"targets", "weights"}`` pair per quantity
(``r``/``t``/``a``/``rb``/``tb``/``ab``, plus ``phi0..phi3`` with a
``gain_shift``), which feed ``needle_gradient``'s matching keywords::

    from navette.smatrix.needle import needle_gradient, NeedleRequest

    g = needle_gradient(stack, needle_n, z_grid, NeedleRequest.P,
                        targets_r=folded["r"]["targets"],
                        weights_r=folded["r"]["weights"])

**Color demands take one extra step.** A color demand (Lab/DE2000, White,
Yellow, dominant wavelength, ...) integrates the whole spectrum into a
single residual, so it has no per-point target — it folds instead to
``folded["grads_r"]`` / ``folded["grads_t"]``, the analytic ``dF/dcurve``
per solver point. Those are separate keyword arguments, and leaving them
out yields a gradient with the color contribution silently missing::

    g = needle_gradient(stack, needle_n, z_grid,
                        NeedleRequest.P | NeedleRequest.P_T,
                        targets_r=folded["r"]["targets"],
                        weights_r=folded["r"]["weights"],
                        targets_t=folded["t"]["targets"],
                        weights_t=folded["t"]["weights"],
                        grads_r=folded["grads_r"],     # <- color, R channel
                        grads_t=folded["grads_t"])     # <- color, T channel

The deposits land in ``P_*`` and ``P_T_*`` respectively, so the returned
arrays are the complete gradient of the pointwise **and** color demands —
the same sum ``run_design``'s native pass computes internally. Both arrays
are all-zero for a spec with no color demands, so passing them
unconditionally is safe.

Spectral-label mapping (``(spectral, polarization)`` → CurveId):

===========  ===============================
label        CurveIds (s / p / u)
===========  ===============================
``"R"``      Rs / Rp / Ru (front reflectance)
``"T"``      Ts / Tp / Tu (front transmittance)
``"A"``      As / Ap / Au (absorptance 1 − R − T)
``"RB"``     RBs / RBp / RBu (back-reflectance)
``"TB"``     TBs / TBp / TBu (back-transmittance)
``"AB"``     ABs / ABp / ABu (back-absorptance)
===========  ===============================

Differential-phase labels (transmitted, synthesis-only quantities):

===========  =====================================================
label        meaning
===========  =====================================================
``"PDts"``   arg(t_s) minus the equivalent-medium reference
``"PDtp"``   arg(t_p) minus the equivalent-medium reference
===========  =====================================================

The reference is ``passes · 2π · n_inc · D · cosθ / λ`` (``passes = 1``
for transmitted): the propagation phase through a layer of incidence
medium of the coating's total thickness ``D``. ``PDts``/``PDtp`` map to
the ``Ts``/``Tp`` curves with ``phase=True`` (required — anything else
raises) plus the reference subtraction; ingestion forces phase
normalization (raw radians, ``nf = 1``). See
``docs/spectralweave-target-kinds.md`` for conventions (solver
forward-propagation sign, needle gain shift).

Any other label raises ``ValueError`` — the synthesis side speaks this fixed
vocabulary (the weaver itself accepts anything). Targets with
``phase=True`` become phase demands on the mapped curve's S-matrix element
(R → r_front, T → t_fwd, RB → r_back, TB → t_back; absorption and
unpolarized keys rejected); their values must be radians.
