"""navette_smatrix — a clean Python interface to the ``smatrix`` Rust extension.

This module is a thin, self-contained wrapper around the compiled Rust core. It
owns no physics: every quantity is produced by the request-driven engine
(``core_engine.rs``) or the optimizer (``optimizer.rs``). The wrapper's job is to

  * hold a layer stack + wavelength/angle grid,
  * marshal them into the exact array layouts the Rust functions expect,
  * turn a ``Request`` mask into a dict of named, correctly-shaped results,
  * expose the eigenmode tools (landscape scan, mode finding, field profile).

Conventions
-----------
* ``layer_indices`` is complex, shape ``(n_layers, n_wavs)`` — row 0 is the
  ambient/incident medium, the last row is the substrate. A 1-D array of length
  ``n_layers`` is accepted and treated as wavelength-independent.
* Angles are in degrees by default (pass ``angles_in_radians=True`` to override).
* ``thicknesses``, ``incoherent_flags`` and the two roughness arrays are
  per-layer (length ``n_layers``). Roughness entry ``k`` describes the interface
  at the *front* of layer ``k`` (so ambient entries are unused); ambient and
  substrate thicknesses should be 0.
* Results are 2-D ``[n_angles, n_wavs]``, or 1-D ``[n_wavs]`` when a single angle
  was supplied (the angle axis is squeezed away).

The ``Request`` bit positions MUST stay in sync with the ``REQ_*`` constants in
``core_engine.rs``. The needle operator lives in ``needle.py`` and mirrors the
``NREQ_*`` constants in ``needle_engine.rs``.

# ─── Construction-time validation (R3.1) ─────────────────────────────────────
# The engine is permissive by design: it is also driven by the optimizer's
# inner loop and by Rust-side tests, where a re-check per call would be pure
# overhead. That permissiveness used to reach the user unfiltered, and the
# review harness (validation/review/garbage_in.py) recorded the result: a NaN
# thickness and a negative thickness both produced the *same* numbers as
# deleting the layer; 120 deg silently aliased onto 60 deg; a duplicated
# wavelength turned every dispersion channel into NaN. None of these raised,
# and none warned.
#
# So the checks live here, at the Python user surface, and run once per
# construction (microseconds, not in any hot path). There is deliberately no
# opt-out: a caller who wants the permissive engine can reach it through the
# native Solver, and a silent physics change is worse than a loud error.

    thicknesses : float array, shape (n_layers,)
        Physical thickness per layer (same length unit as ``wavelengths``).
        Ambient and substrate should be 0.
    wavelengths : float array, shape (n_wavs,)
    angles : float or float array
        Angle(s) of incidence, degrees unless ``angles_in_radians=True``.
    incoherent_flags : int array, shape (n_layers,), optional

    roughness_types : int array, shape (n_layers,), optional
        Per-interface roughness model (see :class:`RoughnessType`). Default none.
        **All roughness models are specular-only: they do not account for diffuse
        scatter loss.** NEVOT_CROCE conserves specular energy (R+T=1, a graded-
        interface assumption); the graded types damp both beams (R+T<1) as a form-
        factor artifact. Neither is a derived Total Integrated Scatter. See

    roughness_values : float array, shape (n_layers,), optional
        Per-interface roughness sigma (same unit as ``wavelengths``). Default 0.
    coherence_mode : CoherenceMode, optional
        Default ``FRONT_BLOCK``.

        Treat ``angles`` as radians. Default False (degrees).

        * ``thicknesses`` finite and ``>= 0`` (0 for ambient and substrate;
          there is no upper limit);
        * ``wavelengths`` finite, positive and **strictly increasing** --
          descending grids are rejected rather than sorted, because sorting
