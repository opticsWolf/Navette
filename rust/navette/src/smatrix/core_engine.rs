//   * polarization — which branch(es) must solve at all: s, p, or both.
//   * compute level — how much each solved branch must produce. The levels are
//     nested supersets, so the engine runs at the maximum level any requested
//     observable demands:
//        Intensities : real |r|^2,|t|^2 accumulators only   (cheapest; func_5 path)
//        ComplexAmps : + first-block complex amplitudes      (phases, dispersion, *_c)
//        Cross       : + p-s coherency channel               (Delta, DOP, S2/S3, retardance)
//
// The cross channel intrinsically couples s and p, so a Cross-level request
// forces both polarizations regardless of the per-polarization usage masks.

// Polarization usage: which branch each observable reads from.
